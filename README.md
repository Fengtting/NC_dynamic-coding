# Code for 'Dynamic encoding of biological motion information in macaque medial superior temporal area'
1. We provided the code and example neuron for calculating modulation index(MI) and net response(NR) in 'MI and NR calculaate.rar'.
2. The script 'MI Comparison' was used to compare MI under different conditions(intact VS scrambled,preferred VS nonpreferred head orientation, upright VS inverted, preferred VS nonpreferred walking direction).
3. The script 'NR Comparison' was used to compare NR under different conditions(intact VS scrambled,preferred VS nonpreferred head orientation, upright VS inverted, preferred VS nonpreferred walking direction).
4. The script 'CellClassification' was used to classifiy MST neurons into 4 types(nonsensitive neurons, form neruons, inversion neurons, and walking direction neurons).
5. The script 'Correlation' was used to perform Pearson' Correlation analysis between biological motion feature coding ability and optic flow pattern selectivity of MST neurons.    *Note: python(version2.7) in spyder was used in this study and opertating systems is Windows 10.
